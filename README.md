### A general framework for meta-analysis based on linear mixed-eﬀects models

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A meta-analytical framework to model potentially complex patterns of eﬀect sizes through an extended and ﬂexible structure of ﬁxed and random terms. This deﬁnition includes, as special cases, a variety of meta-analytical models that have been separately proposed in the literature, such as multivariate, network, multilevel, dose-response, and longitudinal meta-analysis and meta-regression. This extended meta-analytical framework is illustrated in:

Sera F, Armstrong B, Blangiardo M, Gasparrini A. An extended mixed-effects framework for meta-analysis. *Statistics in Medicine*. 2019;38(29):5429-5444. [[freely available here](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2019_sera_statmed.html)]

The article also presents the [R package mixmeta](https://github.com/gasparrini/mixmeta) that implements the extended meta-analytical framework and is used to perform the examples in of applications in the article.

The material:

-   *01.StandardMA.R*, *02.MultivariateMA.R*, *03.MultilevelMA.R*, *04.DoseResponseMA.R*, and *05.LongitudinalMA.R* illustrate the general extended framework in specific meta-analytical applications, consistently with the sections in the published article
-   *06a.simul.r* and *06b.simul_parallel.csv* reproduce the results of the simulation study, using simple loops and the parallelized version, respectively.
